## Update

v1.1: May 30, 2024
- Added options to take out nonsense/stop mutations from position-level estimates
- Fixed a bug in position-level lfsr computation 
- The latest version 1.1 is uploaded at docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/roseraosh/rosace)
- cmdstanr is updated and the csv reading format is different from the past. We recommend the user to use cmdstan version 3.25.0 (default install built in the package) and cmdstanr version >= 0.8.0 to avoid the trouble. 
```sh
docker pull roseraosh/rosace:latest
```

## Overview

__rosace__ is an R package for analyzing growth-based deep mutational scanning screen data.  

## Installation

__rosace__ uses [cmdstanr](https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/) to run inference. Please ensure that __cmdstanr__ is properly installed before installing __rosace__. Below is a concise installation command; for complete details, please refer to the official website. 
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("cmdstanr", repos = c("https://mc-stan.org/r-packages/", getOption("repos")))

# use cmdstanr to install CmdStan, this requires a working C++ toolchain and compiler
library(cmdstanr)
install_cmdstan(cores = 4)
```

To install __rosace__ start [R](https://www.r-project.org) and first install devtools by typing
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
```

and install __rosace__ by typing
```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("pimentellab/rosace")
```

If you prefer to use Docker, we also provide a Docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/cbmacdo/rosace-docker) for rosace. You can pull the image in the command line with
```sh
docker pull cbmacdo/rosace-docker
```
More detailed instructions on docker image is provided in this [repo](https://github.com/odcambc/rosace-docker). 

See the full [Installation Instructions](vignettes/installation_instructions.Rmd) for further details and alternative installation options.

## Getting started

```{r eval=FALSE}
library("rosace")
```

We recommend starting with the [vignette](https://pimentellab.github.io/rosace/doc/intro_rosace.html). A vignette for the simulation module [Rosette](vignettes/rosette_simulation.Rmd) is also avaliable.
